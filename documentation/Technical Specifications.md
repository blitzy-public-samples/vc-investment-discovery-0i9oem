# 5. SYSTEM DESIGN

## 5.1 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The Venture Capital Investment Discovery Mobile Application will utilize the following programming languages, chosen for their suitability to specific components of the system:

| Language | Component | Justification |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Swift    | iOS App   | Native language for iOS development, offering optimal performance and access to latest iOS features |
| Kotlin   | Android App | Modern language for Android development, fully interoperable with Java while offering more concise syntax |

## 5.2 DATABASE DESIGN

The application will use Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL as the primary database. The database schema will be designed to efficiently store and retrieve data for venture capital investment discovery. Here's a high-level overview of the main tables and their relationships:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ PORTFOLIOS : manages
    USERS {
        uuid user_id PK
        string email
        string password_hash
        jsonb preferences
        timestamp last_login
    }
    PORTFOLIOS ||--|{ INVESTMENTS : contains
    PORTFOLIOS {
        uuid portfolio_id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string name
        timestamp created_at
    }
    INVESTMENTS ||--o{ ALERTS : triggers
    INVESTMENTS {
        uuid investment_id PK
        uuid portfolio_id FK
        uuid company_id FK
        float amount
        timestamp investment_date
        jsonb performance_metrics
    }
    COMPANIES ||--o{ INVESTMENTS : targets
    COMPANIES {
        uuid company_id PK
        string name
        string sector
        jsonb financial_data
        jsonb social_data
        jsonb market_data
        timestamp last_updated
    }
    ALERTS {
        uuid alert_id PK
        uuid investment_id FK
        uuid user_id FK
        string alert_type
        string message
        timestamp created_at
        boolean is_read
    }
    TRENDS ||--o{ COMPANIES : affects
    TRENDS {
        uuid trend_id PK
        string name
        string sector
        jsonb trend_data

/api/v1/companies
/api/v1/alerts
/api/v1/trends
```

Each endpoint will support standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.

### GraphQL Schema

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  portfolio(id: ID!): Portfolio
  investment(id: ID!): Investment
  company(id: ID!): Company
  alerts(userId: ID!): [Alert]
  trends(sector: String): [Trend]
}

type Mutation {
  createPortfolio(input: PortfolioInput!): Portfolio
  addInvestment(input: InvestmentInput!): Investment
  updateCompanyData(input: CompanyUpdateInput!): Company
  markAlertAsRead(id: ID!): Alert
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  portfolios: [Portfolio]
}

type Portfolio {
